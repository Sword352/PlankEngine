# Friday Night Funkin': Plank Engine

this engine is currently a WIP and is a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; engine

this engine currently uses the input system from "Strawberry Engine" (we were too lazy to make our own input system or shit like that)

expect updates

## Building
Currently i have only been building in hashlink. To build, you have to have hashlink setup using `lime setup hl` and follow the instructions.
